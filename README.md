# WCGenTrends
Data visualization project written in python utilizing pandas, matplotlib, and openpyxl, that generates 5 visualizations that illustrate Swarthmore Writing Center general traffic trends using historical and current traffic data. Code was written in such a way that it should work with any appropriately formatted Excel data files, so it can be reused in future semesters to quickly generate visualizations based on the latest traffic data.
